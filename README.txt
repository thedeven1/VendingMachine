The vending machine class can accept coins which are represented by strings. 
The string can contain Q's D's and/or N's, in either upper or lower case,
representing quarters, dimes, or nickels respectively. The user can select a product,
and if enough coins are entered, the product will be removed from the machine and given
to the user. If there are not enough coins inserted, the display will read INSERT COIN,
and give the price of the selected product.
